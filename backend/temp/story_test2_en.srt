 Rabbit and Throa, a 1 minute story.

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:11,019
 Once upon a time there was a rabbit.

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:14,660
 He always tried to copy other animals.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,339
 One day he saw a crow.

5
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:22,179
 The crow was sitting on a tree and doing nothing.

6
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:24,699
 Rabbit thought to do the same.

7
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:31,660
 He sat on the ground doing nothing when a fox saw him.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,259
 Fox came near and ate him.

9
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:41,620
 Moral to sit and do nothing you need to be on top.
